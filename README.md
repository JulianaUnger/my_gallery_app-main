This was a group project for the FAU Cloud Computing class and was created in Colaboration with Phaneendra G.
For this project we were tasked with finding and using a cloud service provider then creating a cloud in which 
 took a image from a phone or device and was then uploaded into our cloud. 
 We decided to use Google Cloud and named it MyGallary.
